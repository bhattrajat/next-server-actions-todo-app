This is a simple todo CRUD app created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), React Server components, server actions, Vercel Postgres, tailwind & Prisma.
It also has dark mode :) Inspired by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
